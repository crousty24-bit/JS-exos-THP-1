# JS-exos-THP-1

A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises covering fundamental programming concepts and practical applications.

## Overview

This project contains seven progressive JavaScript exercises designed to build core programming skills. Each script demonstrates different JavaScript concepts including variables, functions, array methods, object manipulation, and regular expressions.

## Project Structure

```
script_1.js   - Variables and String Interpolation
script_2.js   - Functions and Factorial Calculation
script_3.js   - Control Flow and Pyramid Generation
script_4.js   - Array Methods and Data Filtering
script_5.js   - Array Reduction and Advanced Filtering
script_6.js   - Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching
script_7.js   - RNA Translation and Data Mapping
index.html    - HTML entry point
```

## Exercises

### Script 1: Variables and String Interpolation
Introduction to variables, string manipulation, and template literals using user input with `prompt()`.

### Script 2: Factorial Function
Demonstrates function declaration and mathematical computation using loops. Includes type coercion and implicit conversion examples.

### Script 3: Pyramid Generator
Implements nested loops and string manipulation to dynamically generate pyramid patterns based on user input with validation.

### Script 4: Entrepreneurs Data Analysis
Works with arrays of objects and demonstrates array methods including:
- `filter()` - Filter entrepreneurs by birth decade
- `map()` - Transform data into different formats
- `sort()` - Arrange data alphabetically

### Script 5: Book Rental System
Advanced array operations including:
- `filter()` - Check rental status
- `reduce()` - Find most and least rented books
- `find()` - Locate book by ID
- `splice()` - Remove elements from array

### Script 6: ChatBot with Regular Expressions
Implements pattern matching and conditional logic:
- Question detection (ends with ?)
- Case sensitivity validation
- Empty input checking
- Keyword matching (Fortnite)

### Script 7: RNA Translation
Demonstrates object mapping and functional programming:
- Codon-to-amino acid translation
- Array transformation with `map()`
- String manipulation and formatting

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the scripts. The exercises use `prompt()` for user interaction and `console.log()` for output display. Open the browser console to view results.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- No external dependencies

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6+
- HTML5
- Browser Console API

## Notes

These exercises are part of the THP (The Hacking Project) JavaScript fundamentals curriculum and serve as learning materials for basic programming concepts.
